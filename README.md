# British-Airways-Data-Science
-------------------------------------------------------
I just completed British Airways's Data Science on Forage. In the simulation I:
1. Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways success
2. Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
3. Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour
